Bat 3 notes:
Report:  Structure fire call. There was already a structure fire dispatch in Bat 1. Bat 3 arrived on scene right behind E-11 and E-6 on a narrow packed snow and ice covered road. The older single-story wood frame home was on a full basement. Bat 3 established Command behind E-6 off the road with full view of the Alpha and Delta sides. 1101 declared working fire. Safety 10 parked behind Bat 3 and joined Command in Bat 3. 1101 spoke with owner outside and she stated all persons were out and safe. Occupants were in a running POV in the driveway. Command assigned E-11 and E-6 to fire attack and requested Q-10 and E-15 move up from staging located at the beginning of E. Oakview. Q-10 was assigned to ventilation and E-15 assigned to secondary search. Command assigned Bat 2 to staging. Safety 9 was placed in service and asked to cover West Asheville. E-6 quickly split off from E-11, after seeing it was single room and contents fire, and completed a primary search quickly of Division 1. Q-10 brought a gasoline powered PPV to the front door. Fire attack reported fire under control checking for extension quickly. Fire attack requested Duke Energy. E-6 was reassigned to search and moved to primary search of subdivision 1. Fire attack coordinated directly with ventilation to begin. Command requested the main breaker located and turned off. E-15 completed secondary search. E-6 completed primary search of basement and reported many reptiles in enclosures. FM-10 on scene. E-15 completed secondary search of basement and was tasked with checking for extension in the A/B corner of basement. No extension found. Command requested Air 1. Overhaul began. Command released all equipment not on scene and in staging except Air 1. Salvage covers placed over some beds and furniture in the basement. Main breaker located and turned off. Command requested a large salt truck to scrape and salt the road to the scene to make sure the trucks could get out safely. Duke Energy on scene cancelled by Command. 4 gas meter used to check the air quality after ventilation complete. Command released E-15. FM-10 started investigation before any more overhaul done. Occupants refused Red Cross assistance the first time it was offered. The second time it was offered, they accepted. Red Cross notified and called the owner after speaking with Command. The interior and exterior wall covering was removed to check for extension once FM-10 was done. FM-10 transported 3 half sheets of plywood to the scene from staged Air 1. The two windows that were broken were covered. 1101 assisted the owner with retrieving some needed items.

The front porch is sinking, the sidewalk from the parking area is undermined and the foundation of the double wide is seriously compromised by several small sinkholes around and under the structure.  Zach and I attempted to contact the owner but his voice mailbox was full and his wife’s number had been disconnected.  We left him a text stating that we were disconnecting the utilities.  FM 10 Grover Kent arrived on site and contacted Duke and Progress Energy.  Power and gas were cut off at the property edge, and the water was shut off at the meter.
The owner of 221 was present, there is a deep sinkhole under her front porch.  She has contacted a structural engineer and her insurance company and is not staying at the house, but has elected not to have the utilities disconnected.

I will be attaching photos to the record once I get them from Zach.  His were taken in the daylight and are better than the ones I was able to get.

Subject: 40 N. Lexington
Goodmorning J,  We spoke on Saturday March 5th about 40 N. Lexington.  Apparently these tenants, Trading Post and Bead Co. have been having an ongoing issue with the sewer system overflowing into their business.  Saturdays event was the third time in 8 months that their business has had raw sewage flow out of the floor drain.  The owner of the building has the pipes cleaned by roto rooter every month but it doesn't seem to have solved the issue.  The ladies name that owns the business is Deborah Coule and her phone number is 828-236-2323.  Thank you and have a wonderful day.

I issued a stop work order at 24 Hamden RD for work without a permit. The work included framing, electrical, hvac, and plumbing to finish out what looked to be an unfinished storage room. There looks to be a newer electrical panel and plans to extend existing bath to add a shower and laundry room? There was evidence of hvac work with material for the dryer and registers for new duct work. A $400 penalty was assessed to work without a permit.

Building safety inspections received a complaint from an employee of City Electric Supply at 121 1/2 Sweeten Creek Rd. about unsafe conditions due to the ""ceiling falling down.""  Zach Triplett and Chris Fetsko made a site this afternoon and confirmed that the building has severe structural hazards. They told the employees to vacate, which was done, and have posted the building as unsafe.  The management was told to secure an emergency repair permit immediately, as they have repair work scheduled for this coming Friday, March 25th.

A new building is proposed for restaurant and retail use with a new site layout for parking. Conceptual plans have been created for two scenarios based on the finish floor elevation of the building. The first option is a finish floor elevation of 2032’ with flood proofing of the building. The second option is raising the building finish floor elevation to 2034’. In both cases, the elevations of the current site within the floodway will remain at existing elevations.

Ft. each of a portion of space that Apro Tech has relinquished back to ASC Business Park. These spaces have been created by erecting chain linked fenced in areas with plastic tarps on the outside.
My concerns are egress distances, space or suite identification numbers and exiting signage and emergency lighting. There have been no reviews for dividing this space and the renting agency has not required any permits for same.
If I can be of any help please let me know.

The units will be built on pilings 10'-12' off the ground. There is a small flood way close to the river where there will be no buildings in that area as there is also a sewer line that runs through that part of the property. Some of the units on the lower level will offer handicap accessible units. Ramps from the ground to these units will provide the access. Parking will be facilitated by using the space underneath the building. Water and sewer availability have already been approved. Some conversation has taken place with storm water dept. I am not sure what level of LEED certification will be achieved but will try to get a low classification if at all.

Subject: Sprinkler activation
Jay,
A sprinkler activation occurred at 100 Peacock Lane today. The cause was a water heater failure in Apt # 212. Water damage also occurred in Apt #203 and 204. Power was disconnected to all units affected and a fire watch was established and will continue until the sprinkler system is repaired and returned to service. First Restoration was on scene and advised to acquire proper permits before work was performed.
 
Thank You,
Assistant Fire Marshal,

We have the preliminary survey for that lot at .21 acres, which we already submitted to the City mistakenly as a minor subdivision. After completion and sale of the first home, we hope to develop the rest of the property, starting with an 8-unit cottage development on the next parcel which will be across the new road from the home at 127. We hope that will provide work-force housing close to town and to the bus stop on Fairview Road. With the exception of a few NC GreenBuilt homes on the ridge with mountain views, it is our intention to build small, affordable NC GreenBuilt homes, including a few net-zero homes. We own an adjoining acre PIN 9658.17-11-6620, in addition to the parcel we are currently hoping to subdivide now. Moving forward we hope to work with a local land planner.",2016-06-28 16:30:06.043,PUBLICUSER2223,A

I was called by AFD the evening of 7/22 about a kitchen fire at 61 Bingham in the Woodbridge Apartments.  The fire was concentrated at the stove and the kitchen cabinets directly above the stove. The kitchen circuits (receptacle and range) were shut off at the panel box and the tenant has moved out.  I have spoken with Tracey Holbert, the site manager and made a site visit.  Management will obtain a qualified electrician to check the electrical system before turning on the breakers and will be hiring a restoration company. Tracey’s number is 828-250-0159.

Russell, 
Please have a facilitator create a ""Services/Complaint-Enforcement/Commercial Bldg/FMO Referral"" (muni bldg) and attach these pictures to the case.
Facilities Maintenance will need to pull a Repair-Replacement permit to replace the affected door.

Debbie,

As a heads up, I wanted to let you know that Facilities Maintenance will be receiving a correction order, from our Fire Marshal's Office, regarding a door they modified at the Municipal Building. This door opens into a two hour rated exit passageway, which is why it was a 90 min. fire door. This correction work needs a be done through a building permit. The door will need to be replaced as soon as possible. I am also copying the DSD Assistant Director, so she can help you with any permitting questions.

Thanks,

ASHEVILLE,16CAP,00000,006PR,"During a routine periodic inspection today, I found the above premise in the middle of adding an office suite upstairs. There are several issues with this, in that this is a preexisting non-conforming building originally constructed in the county. Over the years, these units have taken on personalities of their own, often without permits and a lot of “storage lofts” have been created. This unit just happens to be one of those premises, so I’m unsure if the loft where the office suite is being added is capable of bearing the weight of the structure. I have included a few pictures, but they have added electrical and of course constructed walls/sheetrock. The occupant stated that construction had ceased over the summer due to their hectic season so currently, work is not in progress. I issued them an order of correction to obtain the proper permits, including electrical by August 23 (I go on vacation next week). 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Hello Jay. Just sending you an email about this address. There was a small fire in a ventilation fan in the bathroom, with very little extension. I isolated the bathroom electricity at the breaker panel, and allowed the homeowner to remain in the residence but not use that bathroom. She was calling her insurance company as I left, and there should be a permit process start soon. Let me know if you need anything else from me.

I was called to a fire in a laundromat at the above address.  The fire was located in a dryer, AFD was on the scene and had it extinguished.  The owner has been told to secure emergency repair permits before re-opening.  The dryers are cord and plug units and the building electrical system was not affected, so the owner was told to open a permit for commercial gas piping, building and fire.  The damage was confined to the one dryer unit, so I feel comfortable allowing the business to re-open once the permits are secured.

I received a call from Asheville Fire Marshal 10 (Dewayne) on Sunday 9/4 in regards a tree which had fallen at the above address.  The power has been pulled and the owner contacted.  No one is currently living at this address.  No entry could be gained on that day, and it was difficult to assess all of the damage, as it was a very large tree and a very small house.  The owner is aware I have been notified and that a permit record will be started.  The owner of record is a Lisa L. McElrath, trustee, 275 Lakewood Dr, unit A, Asheville.

Hey Jason,
 
I am passing along a complaint of work (reroof & interior remodel) supposedly being done without a permit.  I called the gentleman back and he said it was located at 3 London Road, asked if I would pass the information along,
 
Hope you are doing well.

I was contacted 9/18/2016 by fire marshal Dwayne Fender after a car ran into the above address.  I made a site visit and met with Brooke, the property manager and the maintenance supervisor.  The car hit about 8’ of wall and window, breaking away the base of the wall which bears the weight of the roof and some of the floor system above.  The residents of the apartment which was struck and the residents of the apartment directly above it have been relocated.  The Management has been told not to let the upstairs tenants return until an evaluation has been made by a structural engineer.  Only one receptacle was in the damaged wall and that circuit has been turned off at the breaker panel.

We responded to a vehicle into a building at 2304 Hendersonville Rd. (Dairy Queen) on Friday 11/18. The vehicle actually hit a storage shed behind the building causing damage. There was power to the storage building due to the computer system for all of the cash registers being in the building. I had them cut the power with the exception of what was needed for the computer system, and advised them that building safety would be contacting them to let them know what actions should be taken at the beginning of the week. I have attached pictures. If you need anything else from me, please let me know.

Hello Jay. We had a vehicle into a building at 370 N. Louisiana tonight. Due to it being steel beam construction, and unoccupied, I felt safe leaving it as is until the morning. The property owner will be contacting the on-call Building Safety Line after 8:00 in the morning to have someone come and look at it. His name is Stuart Greene, his phone number is (828) 252-0755 or cell (828) 712-0937

I was called to the above location by EOC. A car ran into the front of the building. Major damage occurred to the center column in front of the Iron hen. It is not a structural column but does have a roof drain inside the metal framing. They will need a building permit for the repairs. All occupants above the area  were relocated by management to other rooms prior to my arrival.

I was called to the above location around 5:30pm for a AFD truck that ran into the building. There is major structural damage to the building. They are in contact with Brad Stein w/ risk. The gas and water is off to the building and the power is off at the main breaker. They were told to get a lic. Electrician to check out the system and they could use power in some areas while they vacate the building. The building has been posted unsafe and the owner was told to they could only get belongings out but not to operate out of the building.

Subject: STOP WORK ORDER ISSUED; 2377 HENDERSONVILLE RD. SUITE 1

Upon routine periodic inspection I found the above premise to be occupied and under construction. They have moved walls, breached/opened walls up, covered egress doors, combined 2 suites, completed electrical work, have plans to do plumbing and he stated he is waiting on the gas company to hook up his gas….for what I don’t know. 

The current tenant, Mr. Joaquin Hernandez is completing all of the work himself and stated he wanted to open a taco shop/Hispanic Mercantile shop? He didn’t know, and I could not get much more out of him. I issued a Stop Work Order and a $300.00 fine and requested that he obtain the proper permits ASAP. 

Be advised this premise has been vacant for over 5 years, and if he plans on opening a Taqueria, it will be a change of use. I suggest plans be submitted.

Feel free to call me if you have questions.

I noticed today that the front door of the above location was open and a taco truck was parked out front with tables and chairs. Since, there has been no further movement since my SWO being issued and no permits on file I stopped to inquire. I found More work to have been completed without permits (electrical and plumbing) along with the building being filled with random storage and occupants inside cooking and children inside playing. There was a language barrier but I was able to get Mr. Hernandez on the phone and he stated it was his sister now occupying the space, although the current lease is in his name. I ask that they vacate the building and please seek the proper permits. I'm not sure what to do since I have already issued one Stop Work Order. Jay, I would love input on this. 

I have taken pictures and attaching them for reference, as I did last time. You can see the addition of some commercial Sinks and the wiring and walls finished. 

Please advise on how to proceed properly.",2017-01-24 16:50:02.557,ACARROLL,A

While conducting a routine periodic VACANT inspection I found the above premise to be occupied without proper permits and issued an Order of Correction. To date, no work has been completed on the building but U-Haul plans on turning the facility into a large storage facility and has already begun to move in some construction materials for this up fit. Currently, the space is occupied as a U-Haul rental/hitch install/storage facility and the public has access to a portion of the building. There are several life safety issues that will need to be addressed for the facility to remain open/operational right away with the plans/permitting for the up fit to be addressed shortly thereafter. I have given them until Monday to start the process of obtaining the permits for occupancy. Please be advised that this will be a change of occupancy and currently the building is not up to code. I suggest a Level 1 review of this project. Previously the premise was used as factory/industrial.

Please contact me should anyone have any questions.

This unit was originally 2 units and several years ago they opened the space to be one large unit. Just recently, Morosanni and Associates had the unit divided into 2 separate spaces again without proper permits. They have added several walls, installed a new water heater above the ceiling, added a non ADA Compliant Bathroom and installed electrical outlets. 

Susannah, I was informed by Lisa Stephens that John Judd was to be working with you to get the permits? Is this correct? If not, please let me know ASAP, or I will be issuing Morrosanni a citation for work without permits.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: 3695 SWEETEN CREEK RD; BUSINESS TURNED RESIDENTIAL - CORRECTION ORDER ISSUED

Good Morning,

This morning, during a routine periodic inspection I found the above location to be used as a residential/commercial premise. This location was converted from residential to business last year under Permit 15-01421. Upon the completion of my Fire Final last year, I informed the owner that he was not to reside in the structure, as the premise, for all intensive purposes, still appeared to be a house (plans approved as such) and I included this in my notes in Acella and Firehouse. Attached are pictures of my findings this morning and a copy of the correction order.

I issued him an Order of Correction to discontinue use of the space as a residential occupancy or obtain proper permits to turn the structure back in to a residence. My question to ANYONE in Development Services (Mark…Jay?) is can this space be used a live/work unit? It is a construction company that uses the garage as his storage facility and he has a sign at the road for business presence.  

I’m not sure what the rules are and since the Fire Marshal’s office has no governing over residential structures I see this as a Building/Zoning issue. Can someone weigh in on the issue, as I have several more premise in my area that I need to visit that I’m sure has the same problem.  From a Fire Marshal’s perspective the city’s ruling on this is very unclear and it would be of great help for all inspectors and pertinent city branches to work in conjunction and make a consistent structured procedure when this occurs. If, collectively as a whole, we knew how to officially address the situation it would make everyone’s job a little easier and less unsettling.

Please contact me if you should have further questions. In the meantime, this gentleman should be visiting Development Services within the next few days. 

Thanks,

I have a property owner that is a neighbor and reporting that there is a building on the property in the back that manufacture-do something with wood. They have construction trucks and equipment at the residence.  Have had dumpsters in the drive.  The neighbor has several pictures of the information. At this time he didn’t want to leave a name and number but said if you drive in his driveway you can get a good view (26 Pressley). The address shows a home occupation permit from 2007 for the basement of house to be used as an office for MCG but no other permits only some previous violations.  I left the neighbor know we would send someone by to take a look.
Thanks

ASHEVILLE,17CAP,00000,001J1,"The Tyler Building is a partially leased existing building (approximately 72,000 sf total on 3+ floors). There is an existing photography studio on the Rankin (upper level); and long standing antique store tenant on the middle floor; and several small existing retail tenants fronting Lexington Avenue. Several years ago (6 to 8 years ago) Jacqueline Schauer, Architect worked with John Lantzius (former owner) to upgrade exiting, add an exit stair and add tenant separations for the uninhabited spaces on the Rankin and Lexington levels. That work done in a piecemeal process (according to Jackie Schauer) and it was only partially completed (exterior storefronts and interior exit stair are in place but other interior walls were only partially built). Also, there has been some electrical work (meter base was set) and interior plumbing rough-in work that was done, but Jackie was not aware of any P,M,E engineering involvement - and again that work is incomplete. Structural engineering for Jackie Schauer's plans was done by Sutton Kennerly (mostly related to cutting in the new exit stair), and Sutton Kennerly did a separate floor loading report /assessment and Medlock Engineering was involved with some work related to the roof and to sagging lintels along Lexington. And, a sprinkler system for the uninhabited spaces has been partially constructed and recently a new sprinkler contractor was hired by the owners to complete the sprinkler scope (there may be an open sprinkler permit for this project - but I didn't see one noted in the portal). The purpose of this meeting will be to meet with City Building and Fire staff to determine a path forward to permitting, possibly phasing, and completing a shell building scope for the entire building so that the owner can start to lease the uninhabited spaces on the Lexington and Rankin Levels; and also to develop a plan and process for future upgrades to the currently inhabited spaces as they turn over so as to eventually bring the entire building into code compliance. Last thing - this building takes up an entire City block and has various addresses on Rankin and Lexington and Walnut - so re-addressing may be need to happen - as part of this permit/shell building process (I'm not sure if Stuart needs to be in this initial meeting but I wanted to bring it up in case you all think he or someone from zoning should attend). I am in the process of getting the old plans from Jackie Schauer and will send you her floor plans today in a separate email - they will be a good starting point for discussion - but i have not yet verified what what was and wasn't built on those plans. Also, FYI - this building is located across the street from the Carolina Lane Live work unit  project (not yet, but soon to be submitted for plan review) and it is owned by the same owners as that project - I believe that will kick us into the level one site plan review process but would like to confirm that in our meeting. And one more thing - water is available to the existing portions of the building, but since less than half of the building is occupied and we will be increasing the inhabited area by approximately 40,000 sf - is water availability for the new spaces something that will require City review?",2017-03-06 12:07:54.977,PUBLICUSER0,A

ASHEVILLE,17CAP,00000,001MJ,"During a routine periodic inspection, Assistant Fire Marshall Salters and I found the above location to be constructing work without permits. They have erected two small walls, painted several spaces, and ripped up and replaced the tile flooring. With the erection of one wall an additional sprinkler head may need to be installed, but that will need to be determined by a sprinkler design engineer. We have given them until Tuesday March 7, 2017 to apply for the proper permits.

Also be advised that during this inspection we also found a large portion of the rear wall partially exposed and the metal studs opened and severely warped. They have damaged these walls with the loading and unloading from a fork lift. We took a few pictures but please note that this occurrence has happened at places along the entire back wall. I am requesting that a Building Inspector take a look at this ASAP. This could be a potentially unsafe portion of the building.  Jay, if you recall, this is the back wall that we had issue with before, and it has gotten progressively worse!  Can you please make sure this is addressed?

ASHEVILLE,17CAP,00000,001PK,"Tyler Building shell permit. The Tyler Building is an existing ~72,000 sf, 3 story building located downtown and is currently only partially occupied. The building had some construction work done a few years ago, but that work was never completed (due to the previous owner's death). Now, the current owners want to complete construction of the interior building elements (exits stairs, sprinklering, P,M,E, and other) as needed to be able to lease the remaining uninhabited space. We met yesterday to discuss issues related to permitting but that meeting ended up focusing mostly on zoning issues related to Level two site plan review, addressing and water availability. I would like to set up another meeting to review issues relating building and fire code issues, specifically: shell permit scope, exiting and tenant occupancies, and building construction type as it relates to existing tenants and future tenant turn over/full compliance. Based on yesterday's discussion, I have requested the permit history on the property and hope to have that information available to review during our meeting - so we can discuss what work (if any) was not permitted and what to do about it - and also to determine if a site visit would be helpful in sorting this out. Also, for administrative purposes, the zoning staff told me to call this upcoming meeting a TRC pre-app meeting - because I paid for the the meeting yesterday and it was mostly about TRC pre-app which I guess it typically a ""free"" meeting.",2017-03-10 12:32:34.640,PUBLICUSER0,A

Meadow Road runs along the east portion of the site. The north property line bisects the Amboy bridge. The area along the south property line is largely unobstructed.  The property to the south is owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company.   The west property boundary runs along the French Broad River.  The west portion of the site is wooded and slopes down to the river.  
The confluence of the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers is located southwest of the site. The entire property is located within the floodway.

Units 101,102 and 106 will be left off until repairs can be made. A total of 7 people have been relocated for the near future. They will need permits for all 5 trades. There were no fire sprinklers in the building. Misty has started a record in acella.

Sent: Wednesday, March 29, 2017 12:00 PM
To: Permit Application Center; Misty Lipe
Subject: Order of Correction; Residing in a Commercial Space - 3765 Sweeten Creek Rd.

Upon routine periodic inspection I found evidence of someone residing in a commercial space. The business name is King’s Upholstery and they moved in under an occupancy/no work permit 15-07100  in March of last year. 

As per directed by Mark Matheny, Jay Eichorn, and my supervisor Trevis Allen, I issued the occupant an Order of Correction to discontinue use of the space as a residence and allotted them 14 days to do so. It is to my understanding that I, along with someone from Development Services, will return around the 12th of April to follow up. Could someone schedule appropriately?

Attached are images indicating residential use. Please contact me should someone have further questions.

Below is the site plan for the structures that are being erected at this location.
They are described as portable, however they are 20'x10' and require a ""wide load permit"" to be moved on the road.
They can be picked up by fork truck but require 10' forks. They are sitting on wooden blocks and will have no power to them.
There are 22 of the 20' x10''s and 6 15'x10''s. 
From the description given and the site plan by the installer, it does not appear likely that they will ever be moved.

Hello Jay. Just wanted to pass along that there has been a tree fall through the mobile home at this address. The tenant has left with friends, and I have left a message with the property owner. When he calls back, I will advise him to contact you guys first thing in the morning. If there is anything you need, let me know. 

Thanks

From what I can gather there was a house fire at 343 S FRENCH BROAD AVE.  Gary can you please confirm this is the address, I assume Fire contacted you via the On-Call phone, and Misty can you please create a number.

Thank you

Repair was made to chiller line. Upon refilling chiller line with street pressure water(instead of using the auto fill chiller line with a low pressure PRV), the repair coupling blew out causing a shockwave thru the chiller line system. Some emergency lights, smoke heads and exit light were wet and the fire alarm panel as well.  The fm ten will return when the alarm company returns to evaluate the fire alarm control panel. I inform the maintenance engineer to have his license electrician repair faulty/wet electrical devices. The address of the building effected is in the last picture.",2017-04-24 09:24:13.843,MLIPE,A

Subject: 20 Looking Glass Rd. 

I wanted to pass along the information about 20 Looking Glass Rd. We responded there today at approx. 11:40 am for a tree on the structure. When we arrived we found a large oak tree that had fallen on the structure, and was through the roof, and into the bedroom. I called Red Cross for the owners, and asked them to contact their insurance company about having an adjuster come to look at the damage. I also advised them that I would make contact with our building safety and permit office to have them start a file for their property, and asked them not go in the structure until it was deemed safe. No one was home at the time of the incident. 
 
The owners of the property are Fred Martin (828) 242-4733, and Martha Martin (828) 275-8068

ASHEVILLE,17CAP,00000,002VK,VEHICLE IN BUILDING
I was call by AFD to respond to a vehicle in the building crash. Upon arriving I found out that it was vehicle 312 of the cities sanitation department. It is one of their trash trucks. The truck crashed into the south west corner of the building. The corner of the building was damaged in the area of the break room with a fire rated exterior door. There was no one in the room at the time of the accident. The driver of the vehicle was taken by ambulance to be checked out and the passenger was complaining to shoulder pain. 
The owner called First Restoration company to start closing the opening in the wall as well as installing temporary supports while the corner is reconstructed. There will be pictures to follow. PAC can you please start a record since Misty is out today.

Yes.  I called mid-morning.  This building has sustained damage to one of the corners  in the rear.  There is some kind of damage to the roof that is covered with tarps, so it is hard to see.  What is visible is the damage to the roof that covers the rear porch.  This is the handicap access to the building and the door is an exit door.  I didn’t know if building has already looked at it but I think it needs to be inspected. Thanks

From what I can gather there was a house fire at 343 S FRENCH BROAD AVE.  Gary can you please confirm this is the address, I assume Fire contacted you via the On-Call phone, and Misty can you please create a number.

Thank you

Subject: 2377 Hendersonville Rd. Suites 2 and 6

During a routine periodic inspection of the above location, I found work and occupancy to have been conducted without permits. The occupant previously only inhabited suite 2 but he took over the suite in the back of the building (6), and opened up a few walls to combine the two units. The rear suite 6 has been vacant for many years and has not inspected for at least 9 years due to its vacancy. 

He has done a variety of work including building walls, possible electric (hard to tell since it’s not been inspected before), installed a shower/sink/bathroom and currently resides on site. I have attached some pictures for reference and requested the occupant to obtain the proper permits for all work and occupancy and to discontinue residing in the structure.

I have contacted the building owner and informed him, as the suite next door is also undergoing work without permits. I have previously issued a stop work order on that unit 17-00670S. I am requesting an onsite meeting with building safety/the building owner and the fire marshal’s office. Jay, if you can let me know what day next week works best for you I will contact the building owner and try to set it up.

Stuart, can you advise as to what addresses you have for this location? There are two separate buildings at 2377 Hendersonville Rd (Simplicity has it as not in the city, btw…but after research we believe it is). I would love to get these suites corrected since the two separate incidents of work without permits has essentially done away with 2 of the suites.

Thanks for everyone’s assistance to the matter.

On 5/19/17 I wrote a stop work order for work being done without a permit. (See pictures)  The owners had applied for an occupancy permit stating no work was to be done.  There is a wall being built and electrical work being done.  I (FM-14) assessed a $300.00 fine - building, electrical and fire.   I left the stop work order at the business, as the owners were not there.  The business is addressed as 10 N. Spruce St.  #120 but there is another address where they access the building. That is 12 Lawyers Walk.

Due to a complaint call,  AFM Lewis Garrison and I went to “Breakout” at 60 Patton Ave.  I had approved the permit (#16-03429) on 5/26/16.  This permit covered the scope of work for the upstairs game rooms.  Since then, they have built more rooms on the lower level with door hardware that is not ADA compliant and with locks on the doors.  All  of this work was done without permits.
                I wrote a citation for $1000.00 ($250.00 for each door lock) and wrote a correction order, instructing them to apply for a permit for the work that was done.  AFM Garrison posted the rooms on the lower as “Unsafe” and the business has been told not to use those rooms on the lower level  until the permit has been approved.

Good morning Susannah – 

I received a visitor this morning (via the City Manager’s Office) and ended up performing a research request for a zoning determination letter on the spot.  Can you please help me create a zoning research record for 10 Crestwood Lane?  Once done I will attach the letter and related attachments.  He paid the standard $104 fee but I gave it to Patty to deposit.  

Thanks!
