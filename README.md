# City of Asheville Development Services & Permitting Skills Task
A skills assessment for a Digital Services Systems Analyst position.

The Digital Services Systems Analyst position is a cross-functional position between the Information Technology Services (ITS) Department and the Development Services Department (DSD).  Being such, it is important that the candidate have technical expertise to support various systems in place as well as have the capacity to understand real world business problems that arise in the development community.

##The Problem

At the City of Asheville, we provide citizens and city employees with access to data in several ways. One of our goals at the City is to be as transparant as possible and to provide a rich, seamless, and engaging experience for citizens that will allow them to answer questions on thier own with minimum City staff involvement. To this end, one of the most significant deficiencies in the city’s data offerings is a lack of summary statistics (or dashboards) for the datasets we provide. We’ve had an increasing number of requests from our internal customers (city employees) for dashboards on various datasets used by the city, and we think that a similar need exists in the citizen community as well. 

##The Task 

If you are hired for this position, part of your job would be workig with data to extract userful information for internal and external users alike.  We’d like you to complete a small task so that we can learn about how you approach problems, and hopefully get to know you better in the process.  We will provide you exports from our pemirtting database (Accela), a data dictionary, and a good overview on the Accela reporting basics.  

We'd like you work with the data provided and share with us any useful information that you may come up with.  Be as creative as you'd like to in the way that you share.  

To give a starting point, some things that might be interesting to discover would be:

1. How is the City doing on our Service Level Agreement (SLA) with Customers in the plan review process?  Each permit might have an 'Addressing', 'Building Review', 'Fire Review','Routing', or 'Zoning Review' task - and the SLA Achievement for each task should be treated separately.  Are there certain record types that are consistantly failing to meet the SLA? Does it depend on another attribute?  What else did you discover?  To analyze the SLA Achievement, you should only need to utilize one view which has been exported as 'FirstPlanReview_SLA_Achievement.csv'

2. We have exported the major Accela transactional tables and made them available to you here.  Our citizens and internal management would like to know what's going on with permits in the City.  What do you think would be interesting to discover and present to the citizens or
