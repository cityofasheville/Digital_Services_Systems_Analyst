# City of Asheville Development Services & Permitting Skills Task
A skills assessment for a Digital Services Systems Analyst position.

The Digital Services Systems Analyst position is a cross-functional position between the Information Technology Services (ITS) Department and the Development Services Department (DSD).  Being such, it is important that the candidate have technical expertise to support various systems in place as well as have the capacity to understand real world business problems that arise in the development community.

##The Problem

At the City of Asheville, we provide citizens and city employees with access to data in several ways. One of our goals at the City is to be as transparant as possible and to provide a rich, seamless, and engaging experience for citizens that will allow them to answer questions on thier own with minimum City staff involvement. To this end, one of the most significant deficiencies in the city’s data offerings is a lack of summary statistics (or dashboards) for the datasets we provide. We’ve had an increasing number of requests from our internal customers (city employees) for dashboards on various datasets used by the city, and we think that a similar need exists in the citizen community as well. 

##The Task 

If you are hired for this position, part of your job would be workig with data to extract userful information for internal and external users alike.  We’d like you to complete a small task so that we can learn about how you approach problems, and hopefully get to know you better in the process.
